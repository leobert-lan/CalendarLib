# CalendarLib

Thanks to https://github.com/codbking/CalendarExaple

This project comes from "CalendarExaple"(may be CalendarExample).When I found this Open-Source project,I read the source code as soon.Some issues and bad coding habits were found,considering it is not a stable project published by a famous orgnization(no offense),and with some building config errors,I recreate a project to maintain the functions and more idea will come soon.

To be continued
